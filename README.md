## **Requirement 1**: 
Description of your website including:
- Purpose 
- Functionality/Features
- Target Audience
- Tech Stack 

**Description of the website**

Our team is redesigning and restructuring a website for a tattoo shop called Garage Ink. Our client currently has a functional website but has allowed us to use their IP for the purpose of this assignment. Our website remains property of Coder Academy and will not be incorporated into real world business practises by Garage Ink. Nonetheless, Garage Ink has provided us with some real world suggestions and user stories that they feel are appropriate for consideration when designing a website for their business. 

A tattoo website needs to convey a certain amount of information to its potential customers in order to both attract clients as well as screen out unwanted clients. Some of the information that a site needs to provide includes:
- Tattoo styles
- Location
- Gallery
- Number of Artists 
- Contact Information
- Links to social media

The information listed above is imperative to business operations as it helps provide customers with clear and consistent guidelines in regards to expectations.

The home page of the website will establish the navigation of the page alongside presentation of a complete gallery of all artists that work at Garage Ink. The home page will also group artists by the styles that they work in and further provide a means for users to see the individual portfolio of an artist that piques their interest.

The home page will provide a brief introduction/about us section that will introduce clients to the studio.
The website will be an image focused site that promotes the artists and their portfolio. Each artist will be rendered via a reusable component. The website is a method for customers to find an artist and further connect with the artist they feel is right for them.

**Purpose**

There are a number of factors to consider when discussing the purpose of a tattoo website. Some of the key focus points are:
- Showcasing the portfolio of the artists’ 
- Booking appointments or consultations with a preferred artist
- Establishes a brand and online presence for artists 
- Provides individual recommendations in regards to aftercare techniques and products

**Showcasing an artists’ portfolio**

Artists advertise their work history to new and existing customers by implementing a portfolio. In the tattoo industry, a portfolio is a gallery of art that displays previous pieces that the artist designed and then tattooed. Portfolios are also a means to inform clients of the locations that the artist works. For example, many artists partake in Guest Spot Appearances. A guest spot is where the artist will move around and work at different locations/studios temporarily before returning to their home studio/location.

All of this information needs to be conveyed in a clear and simple manner so that customers can find it and make decisions based upon the information provided.

**Booking appointments/consultations**

Consultations are an opportunity for the client to meet the artist before committing to a tattoo. From the client’s perspective, they are used to convey ideas, stories, reference photos and availabilities. From the artist’s perspective, they are used to explain any and all limitations in regards to tattoo placements and reference photo issues (too blurry, copyright issues etc). 

Artists also use this time to provide an estimate to the client pertaining to expected time to complete the piece as well as the costs involved. 

**Establishes a brand/online presence**

Tattoo artists earn a living by producing a reliable standard of work that attracts clients. This however, is one small factor of an overall larger picture.
Tattoo artists leverage social media and other online websites to gain increased reach and in turn, generate a larger audience/client base. Unlike physical advertisements, online advertisements are capable of reaching clients around the country and even the world. By creating a strong online presence,  artists can achieve the following:
- Engage with a larger target audience
- Connect with other industry professionals 
- Establish a reputation that is easily accessible to new clients
- Establish credibility in terms of skill, knowledge and opinion

Connecting with other industry professionals opens the door to partaking in events such as Guest Spot Appearances and Tattoo Conventions. Both of those events in turn generate more income and reputation for the artist.

**Summary**

With consideration of the previous subheadings and listed items, the purpose of our website can be understood more clearly. 

Our website aims to promote the artists at Garage Ink in a manner that is more effective than the current existing website. Additionally, the intention of our website is display content to clients in a manner that is easily digestible, visually appearing and intuitive to navigate. By considering the fundamental reasons/purposes of a tattoo website, we will strive to employ modern web standards and techniques to the site in order to better convey a professional and reliable business. 


**Features**

Our application will boast a number of features; some of these features bring a larger magnitude of impact to the visual or computational behaviour of the site whereas others a merely quality of life improvements that have been suggested to us by our client, Garage Ink.

The feature list is as follows:
- Showcase galleries of different tattoo styles and - artists' portfolios.
- Allow users to book appointments and consult with artists online.
- Provide educational resources such as aftercare instructions and FAQs.
- Create a social community where users can share their tattoos, connect with artists, and exchange ideas.
- Display pricing information for different types of tattoos and add-ons such as touch-ups.
- Include customer reviews and testimonials to build trust and credibility.
- Use high-quality images and videos to create a visually appealing website.
- Implement a search bar or filters to help users easily navigate the galleries and find the style they're interested in.
- Offer a blog section to share industry news, tips, and behind-the-scenes content.
- Create a "Tattoo of the Day" feature to showcase a daily featured tattoo and its story.
- Allow users to book appointments and purchase gift certificates through the website.

**Target Audience**

Tattoo websites are created to engage with multiple different audiences. The audiences that are specifically targeted with our application are:
- People interested in getting a tattoo
- People interested in finding a new artist 
- People interested in learning about the aftercare of a tattoo
- People interested in researching or considering a variety of tattoo styles and techniques 
- Other tattoo shops/artists that are interested in networking or undertaking a guest spot at the studio

Upon reviewing the target audience for the site, it is clear that our application needs to provide key information such as;
- Artist information and portfolios 
- Logistics information such as location and nearby accommodation or transport
- Modern and accurate aftercare information, potentially more generalised to cater to a wider audience



**Tech Stack**

The tech involved with developing our Front End is as follows:
- HTML
- CSS
- TailwindCSS (Framework)
- JavaScript 
- React

The tech involved with developing our API and Back End are as follows:
- MongoDB
- Express (Node.js framework)
- Node.js

**React**

This is a JavaScript library that is used to build User interfaces by means of reusable components.

**TailwindCSS**

TailwindCSS is a utility first CSS framework that provides consistent design restrictions in order to produce reliable and consistent design patterns. TailwindCSS is used inline and further helps reduce the total number of files in an application. A feature that we intend to leverage is known as ‘purge’. TailwindCSS is able to detect unused CSS utilities and purge them from the production build, this results in a marginally smaller overall file size as well as DRY styling.

**MongoDB**

MongoDB is a document-oriented database that utilises JSON like document structures with optional schemas. MongoDB stores its documents in collections and as a result, returns lightning-fast CRUD operations.

**Express**

This is a Back End framework incorporated for the development of RESTful APIs. It has many incredibly useful features such as robust routing (HTTP), high performance focus and also extensive test coverage.

**Node**

Node is an open-source server environment/runtime. It is capable of generating dynamic page content, CRUD operations and database modification.

**Summary of existing functionality**

**Navigation**

Navigating through the page is difficult and the site does not lead the user towards important information. 

For example, lets say a user wants to get a tattoo in the Traditional Japanese style. When the user arrives on the homepage, they are greeted with overused and repeating animations but no information in regards to what styles the shop tattoos. Logically, they will decide to head to the artists section next to see if they can find more information there. The artist section is only a short scroll down the page but it does not offer any additional information in regards to what artists do what styles.

Instead, the user is greeted with the profile pictures of the artists. As a result, in order to find out whether any of these artists tattoo the Traditional Japanese Style, they will need to sift through each artists page individually. Additionally, there are 13 artists at the studio whereas the website only displays 10. This means that the information is out of date and may result in lost clientele. 

**Styles**

The studio has artists that produce pieces in a wide variety of styles. These include but are not limited to:
- Colour realism
- Black and Grey realism 
- Blackwork 
- Animal portraits 

Above, I have provided just a few of the styles that are produced by artists at the studio. The site does not display this anywhere on the home page and briefly describes it on the artist’s profile page.

Some of the artists specialities overlap and as such, they should be grouped by category to provide the client/user with options regarding their choice of artist or even style.

**Gallery**

On the homepage, the gallery is located in the footer. The gallery of a tattoo studio is the centrepiece of the business. It is the main tool utilised in advertisement and networking, yet it is located in the footer, almost as though it was an afterthought. Additionally, when a user clicks on an image in the footer gallery, the image remains small and does not respond appropriately. 

There is a gallery for individual artists on their profiles, but again, this is information that should be front and centre to the user.

**Spelling and Grammar + Inconsistent/Redundant Information**

There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors scattered through the page. An example would be the Quick Links navbar located in the footer of the homepage. Quick is spelt “Qick” in this example.

The footer also displays a banner that advertises the web developers own personal site. This is an awful practise in my opinion and will be removed. Customers that pay for a product and the costs related to its deployment are not required to advertise the web developers own site. I suspect this was done without client knowledge as the link is hidden quite well and is only visible when hovering over the ‘Web Consultant” words in the banner.

Furthermore, more redundant information can be found on the socials tab. There are artists on the social tab that are no longer employed by Garage Ink. They have been correctly removed from the Artists navbar tab, but not the social tab. There are also current artists missing all together throughout the site.

The social tab is also messy and will be redesigned to utilise familiar logos that will help inform the user where the links will take them.

## **Requirement 2 – Dataflow Diagram**

The Dataflow Diagram is pictured on the next page. A legend has been provided to afford ease of reading and functions as follows:
- Yellow = Main represents the overall app. The pages, the content, the links etc
- Green = Features, more precisely, features involved with handling data
- Orange = Areas where data is stored or manipulated

<details>
<summary>Dataflow Diagram</summary>

![DFD](images/DFD.png)

</details>

By nature, a tattoo website revolves around the presentation of visual content. Often, there is little to no need to take or manipulate data from a user. To meet the assessment criteria, we have incorporated features that allow users to interact more than a typical studio would. The features that are not directly involved in storing, fetching or accessing data are irrelevant to the data flow diagram and as such, they are excluded to simplify how the site functions.

**Artist Login (Admin)**

Artists from the studio will occupy administration roles in the database. They are allowed to post photos and other content directly to the gallery. They are also capable of updating their own personal artist pages with new photos etc. Because these activities directly affect site functionality, they are restricted to admin privileges and require authentication.

**Customer Login (User)**

In order for users to interact with the site, they must create an account. As described via the HTTP verbs in the dataflow diagram, users can perform activities such as POST a review or GET pricing information related to an artist. 



## **Requirement 3 – Application Architecture Diagram**

<details>
<summary>Application Architecture Diagram</summary>

![DFD](images/AAD.png)

</details>

Application Architecture Diagram pictured on the following page displays an overview of how the application is structured and further denotes how it interacts with other technologies. For example, the Front End is developed by implementing a number of reusable components to display content. A good example may be a component to display an image, or a series of images even. On initial page load, these components will rendered and the user will be presented with the home page. Users will need more than just the homepage however; lets say they want to visit the shop. The routes, or addresses of other pages are described and affixed to the homepage via the controllers. The shop for example is linked to the homepage. Visiting the shop will send a GET request to the API. The shop features a number of products that are stored in the database. After the browser sends the GET request to the API for the shop page, the API will respond by providing the requested page, alongside any relevant information that it received from the database. 

The front end will have components implemented to describe the intended layout of the shop page and these components will be rendered upon the response from the API.

The picture on the next slide is a terrific example of how communication takes place between different sides of the application and studying the image will inform you of all user facing operations.

## **Requirement 4: User Stories**

**User Story 1 - First time Tattoo Client**

As someone who has never had a tattoo before, I am looking to find information to help me make an informed decision relating to what style suits my preferences and whether or not my idea translates well in the tattoo art medium. Because I have never had a tattoo before, I am unsure about how the overall process works. I need information about concepts, consultations, the tattooing process, the cost, the aftercare and the time it takes to complete. 

I am also unsure about how painful the tattoo will be and if the area being tattooed affects the overall intensity of the pain.

With this said, I need access to the following things in order to proceed with my first tattoo:
- Information on art styles
- Access to portfolios from multiple artists
- Information on the artist performing the work
- Consultation information regarding prices, sizes and concepts
- Booking information 
- Types of payment methods/Costs
- Aftercare information

**User Story 2 – Tattoo enthusiast looking to change artists or try a new shop**

I have had multiple tattoo sessions already so I am quite familiar with the typical process conducted at different shops. My usual artist has moved to another country and will not be returning any time soon. Due to this, I need a new artist but I am reluctant to make the switch unless I can find an artist that has a similar style to my existing tattoos.

I currently have multiple colour realism pieces, an entire arm sleeve to be more precise and also some smaller pieces on my chest. As my existing tattoos are in a visible area, the other tattoos must have a similar style so that they do not clash.

In order for me to make an informed decision about changing to a new artist, I need access to the following information:
- I need to see a complete gallery featuring recent photos of all works completed by artists at the studio
- I need to be able to find artists easily, preferably by sorting through categories of styles
- I would need to find out how to arrange a consult and if there is a charge for this
- I need to know the location of the shop as well as transportation options. If it is far away, I will need accommodation information.
- I need to know a price range for the potential artists so I can determine whether or not I can afford it
- I need to know how busy the artist is and in turn, how long I can expect to wait when I book in

**User Story 3 – Tattoo Artist looking to work for the studio**

I am an established artist that has been tattooing for 10 years. I tattoo 2 styles; neo-traditional and black-and-grey realism. I recently moved states and have been looking for a local studio to work at. This is a massive change and the studio that I choose can have a significant impact on the trajectory of my career. Due to the importance of the decision, I need to know the following;
- How many artists work at this studio
- What styles the artists tattoo 
- Does the website promote professional and updates portfolios 
- Does the website promote social media pages for individual artists 
- Does the shop maintain the standard of work and professionalism that I expect from a modern company



**User Story 4 – I recently had a tattoo done at the studio. I have forgotten the aftercare instructions given to me by my artist, I need to find aftercare information and product recommendations**

I went to this studio and had a large piece completed 2 days ago. Unfortunately, I have forgotten the information given to me by my artist regarding aftercare. As a result, I am needing to find clear, current and accurate aftercare information. The information needs to explain how to apply the aftercare, when to apply and for how long. I would also be interested in recommended products.

I would like to find the following information easily:
- Frequently asked questions regarding aftercare
0 Information surrounding application of aftercare: when, how, why?
- Recommended products as well any relevant warnings associated with said products: sensitive skin etc
- Detailed pictures, guides or steps as to when to apply aftercare
- Information regarding standard healing symptoms and how to know if my healing process is atypical

**User Story 5 – I am the organiser of a popular tattoo convention. I am looking to extend an invitation to select shops based on their capabilities and reputation**

I am the manager of a popular tattoo convention. At the convention, people will be able to meet artists and brainstorm ideas. They will also be able to get a tattoo if they feel the need! Since this convention is open to the public, there are strict rules and regulations surrounding how the event is structured and the activities that can be held for the duration of the event. 

I am looking to invite artists to the convention but I need reassurance that I am inviting professional, talented and well-respected individuals to this event. I need to be able to find the following information:
- I need to know if the artists and professional and presentable, personal photos or profile pictures may help
- I need to know how many artists are at the studio 
- I need to find information about the social media accounts of the artists and how I can contact staff at the shop
- I need to see a gallery for the artists to ensure that they have the skills necessary to perform at the convention
- I need to see customer reviews to assess if the staff are polite, kind and professional

**User Story 6 – I recently had a tattoo done by an artist at the shop. I was showing my new tattoo to some friends and they wanted to see more of the artist’s work.** 

I know that tattoo artists use a variety of websites, tools and platforms to advertise their portfolios but I cannot remember any of the online handles or account names. I really wanted to show my friends the artist’s work so I intend to visit the website in the hopes of finding some direction there. I need to find the following information:
- A profile picture of the artist will help jog my memory of my recent tattoo session
- Names/categories of styles can help me narrow down the artist I am looking for 
-Links to their social medias along side access to their portfolios are needed










## **Requirement 5 -Wireframes (Desktop)**

**Homepage, Hero, Footer**

The wireframes I sketched up for desktop cover the most important features for the site. There are other potential features that may be added to the site, due to time constraints however, only core pages and functionality are designed in the wireframes.
Image 1 contains the Homepage, Hero and Footer wireframes. These designs portray the entire homepage that a user would interact with. Initially, on page load, they will be presented with the Homepage section. After scrolling down the page, they will see the Hero section and upon scrolling to the end of the homepage, they will see the Footer section. 

**Artists, Garage Ink Oeuvre, Individual Artist Gallery**

The Artists and Garage Ink Oeuvre pages are designed to display picture content to users in a clean and easily digestible format. The Garage Ink Oeuvre is a complete collection/gallery of all artists at the studio; it is displayed in a grid format and will present images in an unordered manner. The Artists tab is used for customers to explore choices in regards to style, artist, size etc. It is displayed in a row format and will be split up into categories by style. The gallery at the end of the row (relative to artist name) will likely display as an image carousel.

If a user chooses an artist from the Artists page, they will visit a page set up to display that artist and all of their work. Like the oeuvre, the artist’s individual gallery will be formatted in an unordered grid.

**Consultation, Community, Merch Shop and Blog**

These pages are implanted to increase user interactivity and encourage users to spend more time on the site. They are also incorporated to give users the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the studio. This can be done by reading through the blog or looking at the tattoo of the day. Partaking in these activities establishes the beginning of a relationship between the studio and the client and breaks down the barriers present by default in all situations regarding client’s vs faceless businesses.

The shop is self-explanatory and is present for users to either buy apparel or aftercare products. In particular, the purchase of aftercare products is almost guaranteed for first time clients. New clients often need guidance throughout the entirety of the transaction, from consultation to session to aftercare. Allowing the shop to present their own aftercare in a shop style format grants clients with some reassurance regarding quality, effectiveness and recommendations for said aftercare products. To simplify, a new client will find comfort purchasing an aftercare product that the studio understands intimately, the client will find reassurance knowing that the product will suit their induvial needs.

## **Requirement 5 – Wireframes (Mobile)**

**Differences in the layout and functionality for Mobile**

The differences in mobile functionality and design were supressed as much as possible in order to exaggerate a common theme throughout all versions. Rephrased, functionality has not changed significantly. The Navbar has been replaced with a classic drop-down menu that users are familiar with. Content displayed on the home page has now been tightened and displayed in a traditional heading – content – link order. As you will see in the wireframe for the homepage, the Hero section has been transformed from a large and wide design into the after mentioned heading-content-link format. (Top down)

All other changes were made simply as a direct result of screen size limitations. Galleries have been reduced from 3 columns to 2. The shop has been reduced from 3 items per row, to 2 items per row.

Navigation functionality may extend more in the direction of a mobile friendly navbar along the bottom of the page or perhaps just a home button located in a top corner. These features are not MVP features and will be adjusted accordingly during development.  The Footer will also undergo many transformations but at this stage of planning, there is not solid outline as to how the footer should be incorporated. It may be removed in its entirety.

## **Requirement 5 – Wireframes (Tablet)**

**Differences in the layout and functionality for Tablet**

The Tablet versions are essentially the bridge between the two other display modes. Here, we still see a lot of the original designs afforded by the generous real estate of a Desktop. We also begin to see some of the restrictions of a mobile however. The Tablet will feature the same drop-down menu that the mobile does for both functionality and familiarity. Content on the home page will also be displayed in the previously discussed title-content-link format. The galleries maintain the 3-column gird, as does the shop. The blog however shares the same format that the mobile version does. Footer inclusion on the tablet version is undergoing the same uncertainty pertaining to inclusion that the mobile footer is.
